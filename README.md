# MTG Inventory

I play Magic the Gathering. This means I have hundreds of Magic the Gathering cards. How do I keep track of all these cards? This scratch project is an attempt to address this issue.

Minimum Viable Product:
++ Backend: Create database which holds an inventory of cards in my collection
++ Frontend: Display the database inventory on a React page in alphabetical order

Stretch Goals:
++ Create a request route to a third party API to display the image of a selected card on a hover modal over the frontend 
++ Create a dropdown menu which allows for inventory to be displayed by card type, color, converted mana cost, etc.
